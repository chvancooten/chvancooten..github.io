Updated November 3rd, 2021: Included several fixes and actualized some techniques. Changes made to the Defender evasion, RBCD, Domain Enumeration, Rubeus, and Mimikatz sections. Fixed some whoopsies as well ðŸ™ƒ.
Updated June 5th, 2021: I have made some more changes to this post based on (among others) techniques discussed in ZeroPointSecurity&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Red Team Ops&amp;rsquo; course (for the CRTO certification). I&amp;rsquo;ve re-written and improved many sections. New sections have been added on DPAPI and GPO abuse.</description></item><item><title>OSCP Cheat Sheet and Command Reference</title><link>https://casvancooten.com/posts/2020/05/oscp-cheat-sheet-and-command-reference/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://casvancooten.com/posts/2020/05/oscp-cheat-sheet-and-command-reference/</guid><description>Updated May 18th, 2020
Since my OSCP certification exam is coming up, I decided to do a writeup of the commands and techniques I have most frequently used in the PWK labs and in similar machines. I aimed for it to be a basic command reference, but in writing it it has grown out to be a bit more than that!
That being said - it is far from an exhaustive list.</description></item></channel></rss>
