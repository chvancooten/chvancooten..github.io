Updated November 3rd, 2021: Included several fixes and actualized some techniques. Changes made to the Defender evasion, RBCD, Domain Enumeration, Rubeus, and Mimikatz sections. Fixed some whoopsies as well ðŸ™ƒ.
Updated June 5th, 2021: I have made some more changes to this post based on (among others) techniques discussed in ZeroPointSecurity&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Red Team Ops&amp;rsquo; course (for the CRTO certification). I&amp;rsquo;ve re-written and improved many sections. New sections have been added on DPAPI and GPO abuse.</description></item></channel></rss>
