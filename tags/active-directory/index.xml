Introduction The &amp;ldquo;Global Central Bank&amp;rdquo; (GCB) labs and accompanying &amp;ldquo;Certified Red Team Master&amp;rdquo; (CRTM) certification are definitely something else. It is more or less the &amp;ldquo;level-up&amp;rdquo; from the respective &amp;ldquo;Attacking and Defending Active Directory&amp;rdquo; (CRTP) and &amp;ldquo;Windows Red Team Lab&amp;rdquo; (CRTE) courses, also provided by AlteredSecurity.</description></item><item><title>Windows &amp; Active Directory Exploitation Cheat Sheet and Command Reference</title><link>https://casvancooten.com/posts/2020/11/windows-active-directory-exploitation-cheat-sheet-and-command-reference/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://casvancooten.com/posts/2020/11/windows-active-directory-exploitation-cheat-sheet-and-command-reference/</guid><description>Last update: November 3rd, 2021

Updated June 5th, 2021: I have made some more changes to this post based on (among others) techniques discussed in ZeroPointSecurity&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Red Team Ops&amp;rsquo; course (for the CRTO certification). I&amp;rsquo;ve re-written and improved many sections. New sections have been added on DPAPI and GPO abuse.</description></item><item><title>Getting the CRTP Certification: 'Attacking and Defending Active Directory' Course Review</title><link>https://casvancooten.com/posts/2020/10/getting-the-crtp-certification-attacking-and-defending-active-directory-course-review/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://casvancooten.com/posts/2020/10/getting-the-crtp-certification-attacking-and-defending-active-directory-course-review/</guid><description>Updated February 13th, 2023: The CRTP certification is now licensed by AlteredSecurity instead of PentesterAcademy, this blog post has been updated to reflect.
