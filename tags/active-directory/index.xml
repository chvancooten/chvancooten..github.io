It is more or less the &amp;ldquo;level-up&amp;rdquo; from the respective &amp;ldquo;Attacking and Defending Active Directory&amp;rdquo; (CRTP) and &amp;ldquo;Windows Red Team Lab&amp;rdquo; (CRTE) courses, also provided by PentesterAcademy.

Updated June 5th, 2021: I have made some more changes to this post based on (among others) techniques discussed in ZeroPointSecurity&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Red Team Ops&amp;rsquo; course (for the CRTO certification). I&amp;rsquo;ve re-written and improved many sections. New sections have been added on DPAPI and GPO abuse.</description></item><item><title>Getting the CRTP Certification: 'Attacking and Defending Active Directory' Course Review</title><link>https://casvancooten.com/posts/2020/10/getting-the-crtp-certification-attacking-and-defending-active-directory-course-review/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://casvancooten.com/posts/2020/10/getting-the-crtp-certification-attacking-and-defending-active-directory-course-review/</guid><description>Introduction As a red teamer -or as a hacker in general- you&amp;rsquo;re guaranteed to run into Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Active Directory sooner or later. Almost every major organization uses Active Directory (which we will mostly refer to as &amp;lsquo;AD&amp;rsquo;) to manage authentication and authorization of servers and workstations in their environment. It is a complex product, and managing it securely becomes increasingly difficult at scale.
It is exactly for this reason that AD is so interesting from an offensive perspective.</description></item></channel></rss>
