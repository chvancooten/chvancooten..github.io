I had heard a lot about this course prior to enrolling in it myself - almost exclusively consisting of positive reviews. The author of the course, RastaMouse, is quite a well-known figure in the infosec community. You may know him for his open-source tool contributions, such as Watson or ThreatCheck, or if you are a HackTheBox-enthusiast you may know him for the RastaLabs pro lab.</description></item></channel></rss>
