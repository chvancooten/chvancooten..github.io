      <description>The first part of this blog post dives into my personal OSCP story. If you&amp;rsquo;re only interested in stuff you can apply to your own PWK journey, jump to the key takeaways or the OSCP FAQ.
Preamble I don&amp;rsquo;t have a very technical background. I did a Master&amp;rsquo;s in Information Science before starting as a Cyber Security Consultant. In my current role, I deal with various cyber topics on an organizational level - usually not from a very technical perspective.</description>

      <description>For some people, the reporting bit of the PWK course may be their pride and joy leading up to their OSCP certification. For others, it&amp;rsquo;s just a necessity that they want to get out of the way. Either way, handing in a report describing your findings is a requirement posed by Offensive Security - so you&amp;rsquo;re gonna have to do it if you want to obtain that elusive OSCP certification!</description>

      <description>Updated May 18th, 2020
Since my OSCP certification exam is coming up, I decided to do a writeup of the commands and techniques I have most frequently used in the PWK labs and in similar machines. I aimed for it to be a basic command reference, but in writing it it has grown out to be a bit more than that!
That being said - it is far from an exhaustive list.</description>
