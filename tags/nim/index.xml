Nim is a relatively young and fairly unknown programming language that has a syntax quite similar to Python&amp;rsquo;s, so is very easy to pick up. It however offers the flexibility and low-level capabilities of languages like C/C++, and has a great foreign function interface. On top of that, it compiles to native C (as well as some other languages), which results in native binaries that are quite slim.</description></item></channel></rss>
