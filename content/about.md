Hi! I'm Cas, an offensive security enthusiast and Red Teamer based in the Netherlands. I like to play around with anything that is related to hacking, security, or tech in general. I love to learn, but I love sharing the things that I have learned even more - that's what this blog is for. If you would like to get in touch you can do so via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chvancooten) or [email](mailto:hello@casvancooten.com). I'm always up for a chat about (offensive) security!
