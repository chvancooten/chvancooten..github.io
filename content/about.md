Hi! I'm Cas, a Cyber Security Consultant and Red Teamer based in the Netherlands. I like to play around with anything that is related to hacking, security, or tech in general. I love to share the things I've learned, which is why I set up this blog! I would love it if you'd get in touch via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chvancooten) or [email](mailto:hello@casvancooten.com) with comments or suggestions for this blog.

For some reason, some people have expressed the desire to buy me a beer - who am I to object?

Stay geeky ðŸ¤“
